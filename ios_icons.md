# IOS Icons

Icons for iOS apps are to be designed in multiple resolutions so as to serve the Retina displays that were used in modern iPhones and iPads.

## Suggested Dimensions for iOS Icons
- **App Icon (App Store)**: 1024x1024px
- **App Icon (iPhone/iPad)**: 
  - @1x: 60x60px
  - @2x: 120x120px
  - @3x: 180x180px

## Format of Icons
- **PNG**: The most common format for iOS icons.
- **PDF**: iOS also supports vector-based icons in PDF format, in some cases.
 
## App Icon Sample
Create application icons in the following sizes: for example, **40x40px**, **60x60px**, and **180x180px**, and supply the `@1x`, `@2x`, and `@3x` versions of each, respectively.

```plaintext
Icon@1x.png – 60x60px
Icon@2x.png – 120x120px
Icon@3x.png – 180x180px
```

Ensure that each version is correctly scaled for Retina displays.
